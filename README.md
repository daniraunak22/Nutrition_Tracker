Nutrition Tracker:

Project Motivation:

Currently, within America specifically, obesity is a very large and meaningful issue that needs to be paid attention to. Combatting obesity includes 2 different strategies – working out and eating right. As someone that likes to work out and control my diet strictly, my project will help combat obesity via the second solution – eating right. Therefore, the goal of my project is to create a nutrition tracker, which takes in a user’s calorie and macronutrient goals, then takes in the food they have eaten during the day, and then outputs how much of each macronutrient they have consumed, displaying graphs to pictorially represent their goals. 

What I learned:

While coding this project, I was introduced to a new concept called APIs. I learned how to utilize the requests library within python to be able to call an API, which gave me access to the MyFitness Pal databases - one of the most comprehensive databases for calorific values of foods available online. Furthermore, as needed with APIs, I was able to learn more about python such as monitoring the response codes (of successful and unsuccessful passes to the API) and the use of the .get() function to extract the food names, brands, serving sizes, and calories. Overall, I was very happy with my final project, and by coding this project, I have gained confidence in my use of APIs for the future.
